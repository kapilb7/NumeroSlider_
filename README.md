Your goal is to place the pointer as close to the target value and also as quickly as possible. Quick math of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division is all you need, to get the target value. Slide the pointer as close to the value within 3 seconds and triple you score. Itâ€™s time to put on your speeding and math cap to keep the scoreboard ticking.
