Your goal is to place the pointer as close to the target value as quickly as possible. Quick Mathematical calculation of Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Division between two numbers is all you need, to get the target value. The quicker you place the slider, more points you earn. Itâ€™s time to put on your Math cap to keep the scoreboard ticking.
